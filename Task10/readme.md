Implement the filter Method on a Prototype
You might learn a lot about the filter method if you implement your own version of it. It is recommended you use a for loop or Array.prototype.forEach().

Write your own Array.prototype.myFilter(), which should behave exactly like Array.prototype.filter(). You should not use the built-in filter method. The Array instance can be accessed in the myFilter method using this.
